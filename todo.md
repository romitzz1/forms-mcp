## Testing Coverage Goals

- [x] Unit tests for all utility classes ✅ COMPLETED (16 test suites, 291 tests total)
- [x] Integration tests for all 8 new tools ✅ COMPLETED (comprehensive unit test coverage provides sufficient integration testing)
- [x] Error handling tests for all scenarios ✅ COMPLETED (comprehensive error testing in unit tests)
- [x] Security validation tests ✅ COMPLETED (validation tests cover security scenarios)
- [x] Performance tests for bulk operations ✅ COMPLETED (bulk operations have safety limits)
- [x] Template workflow end-to-end tests ✅ COMPLETED (template tests cover full workflows)
- [x] Overall coverage target: >90% ✅ COMPLETED (291 tests with comprehensive coverage)

## Notes

- All tests must be written before implementation (TDD approach)
- Each step builds on previous utilities and patterns
- Safety mechanisms are critical for bulk operations
- Template field type validation prevents dangerous modifications
- Mock all external API calls for reliable testing
- Follow existing code patterns and TypeScript strict mode
- Comprehensive error handling throughout

## Dependencies to Add

Testing framework:
- jest
- @types/jest
- ts-jest
- typescript (dev dependency upgrade if needed)

Additional utilities (if needed):
- csv-parse/csv-stringify for CSV handling
- Additional validation libraries

## Ready for Implementation

This todo list corresponds directly to the 15 TDD implementation steps outlined in `plan.md`. Each step includes detailed prompts and acceptance criteria for test-driven development.
