## Current Status Details

**Completed Research:**
- âœ… Analyzed current `get_forms` implementation - only returns API active forms
- âœ… Analyzed current `list_form_templates` implementation - uses API active forms  
- âœ… Identified all affected tools and utility classes
- âœ… Confirmed no existing database infrastructure (needs SQLite setup)
- âœ… Designed complete architecture for form discovery and caching

**Key Insights:**
- API `/forms` endpoint limitation confirmed - only active forms returned
- `TemplateManager.listTemplates()` and `FormImporter.detectConflicts()` affected
- No current database dependencies - clean slate for SQLite implementation
- Backward compatibility essential - default behavior must remain unchanged

## Implementation Guidelines

### TDD Approach
- Write tests first for each step
- Build incrementally with each step passing all tests
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage throughout
- Mock API responses for consistent testing

### Backward Compatibility
- Default tool behavior unchanged (`include_all=false`)
- Opt-in enhanced functionality (`include_all=true`)
- Graceful degradation when cache unavailable
- No breaking changes to existing MCP tool interfaces

### Performance Targets
- 80%+ reduction in API calls for cached operations
- Efficient handling of 1000+ forms datasets
- Sub-second response for cached form queries
- Minimal memory usage during sync operations

## Risk Areas to Watch

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Discovery process must respect API limits
2. **Database Performance**: SQLite queries must be properly indexed
3. **Memory Usage**: Large form datasets during sync operations
4. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple tool calls accessing cache simultaneously
5. **Error Recovery**: Partial sync failures and data consistency

## Dependencies to Add

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "better-sqlite3": "^9.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/better-sqlite3": "^7.6.8"
  }
}
```

## Configuration Files to Update

- **package.json** - Add SQLite dependencies
- **.env.example** - Add cache configuration variables
- **.gitignore** - Ensure cache database files ignored
- **README.md** - Document new include_all parameters (after implementation)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- FormCache class methods (CRUD, sync, discovery)
- ID gap detection algorithms
- Form probing and beyond-max logic
- Cache invalidation and management
- Error handling and recovery

### Integration Tests  
- Complete discovery workflows
- Tool integration with cache
- API mocking for consistent behavior
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Concurrent access scenarios

### End-to-End Tests
- Real API integration (test environment)
- Cache persistence across server restarts
- Mixed usage patterns (cached vs. API-only)
- Error recovery in production scenarios

## Notes for Implementation

- Each TDD prompt is self-contained and builds on previous work
- Follow existing code patterns and TypeScript strict mode
- Maintain MCP protocol compliance throughout
- Focus on production readiness from the start
- Document configuration options clearly
