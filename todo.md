## Current Focus

🎯 **Ready to start Step 11**: Enhance existing get_entries tool with universal search

Steps 1-10 are complete! The foundation is rock-solid with:
- ✅ Fixed get_entries search syntax 
- ✅ Intelligent response size management (auto-summarization)
- ✅ Core field type detection with FieldTypeDetector class
- ✅ Performance caching with FieldMappingCache (LRU eviction, 1-hour expiry)
- ✅ Universal search manager with intelligent multi-field search coordination
- ✅ Search results formatter with multiple output modes and token management
- ✅ Primary search_entries_by_name tool with full MCP integration
