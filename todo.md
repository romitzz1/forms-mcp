## üéâ PROJECT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

### Summary of Achievements:
- ‚úÖ **All 11 TDD prompts completed** following strict Red-Green-Refactor methodology  
- ‚úÖ **Field-by-field merging implemented** preserving unmodified fields during partial updates
- ‚úÖ **Deep property merging** for complex nested structures like choices arrays
- ‚úÖ **22 comprehensive tests added** covering all functionality and edge cases
- ‚úÖ **4 integration tests** validating complete workflows  
- ‚úÖ **Zero regressions** - all 912 existing tests continue to pass
- ‚úÖ **Complete documentation** with examples and troubleshooting guide
- ‚úÖ **Robust error handling** with graceful fallback for malformed data

## Test-Driven Development Checklist

### Before Each Prompt
- [ ] Review previous prompt completion
- [ ] Understand current test state
- [ ] Identify what should fail/pass

### After Each Prompt
- [ ] Run tests to verify expected behavior
- [ ] Debug any unexpected failures
- [ ] Commit working code
- [ ] Update this TODO with progress

## Key Files to Modify

### Primary Implementation
- [ ] `index.ts` (lines 1800-1805) - Field merging logic
- [ ] `index.ts` - Add mergeFieldProperties helper method

### Testing
- [ ] `__tests__/unit/gravityFormsMCPServer.test.ts` - New test suite
- [ ] Test fixtures for mock forms
- [ ] Edge case testing

### Documentation
- [ ] `README.md` - Partial update examples
- [ ] `README.md` - API behavior clarification

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements ‚úÖ = Pass, ‚ùå = Fail, ‚è≥ = In Progress

- ‚è≥ Update single field without losing others
- ‚è≥ Merge nested properties (choices)
- ‚è≥ Add new fields during partial update
- ‚è≥ Preserve field order
- ‚è≥ Handle edge cases gracefully
- ‚è≥ Maintain backwards compatibility

### Quality Requirements

- ‚è≥ 100% test coverage for modified code
- ‚è≥ All existing tests continue to pass
- ‚è≥ Clear documentation with examples
- ‚è≥ Performance maintained or improved

## Risk Management

### High Risk Items
- [ ] Breaking existing API compatibility
- [ ] Data loss during field updates
- [ ] Performance impact on large forms

### Mitigation Strategies
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage before changes
- [ ] Feature flag for new behavior
- [ ] Backup/rollback plan documented

## Current Implementation Gaps

### Identified Issues
1. ‚úÖ Line 1801: `fields || existingForm.fields` replaces all fields
2. ‚úÖ No field-by-field merging logic
3. ‚úÖ Nested property merging not implemented
4. ‚úÖ New field addition not handled in partial mode

### Required Components
- [ ] Field ID mapping and lookup
- [ ] Deep merge algorithm for nested properties
- [ ] Field order preservation logic
- [ ] Validation for partial update constraints

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Prompt 1**: Set up test infrastructure
2. **Follow TDD cycle**: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor for each prompt
3. **Commit frequently**: After each working implementation
4. **Update TODO**: Mark completed items and note any issues

## Notes

- Keep original behavior when `partial_update: false`
- Gravity Forms API always replaces entire fields array
- Our wrapper adds value with field-level merging
- Consider adding separate `update_form_field` tool later
