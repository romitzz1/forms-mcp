# Universal Name Search Implementation Plan - TDD Approach

## Overview

Implement a fast, universal name search system that works efficiently across ALL Gravity Forms, automatically detecting name fields and providing lightning-fast search capabilities without relying on form-specific configurations.

## Problem Statement

**Current Issues:**
- **Search API Inconsistency**: `get_entries` uses incorrect search syntax (flat object vs array format)
- **Performance Problems**: 66k+ token responses causing context overflow, requiring manual pagination
- **Form-Specific Limitations**: Current searches require knowledge of specific field IDs for each form
- **No Universal Solution**: No way to search for names across different forms without knowing their structure

**Performance Impact:**
- Finding "Example Person" in form 193 required 3+ API calls and manual pagination
- Responses can exceed 66k tokens causing Claude crashes  
- No field detection means guessing which fields contain names vs other data

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **FieldDetector** - Intelligent field type detection
- Analyzes form structure to identify field types automatically
- Caches field mappings per form for performance
- Supports detection of name, email, phone, and team/group fields
- Uses pattern matching on field labels and types

#### 2. **UniversalSearchManager** - Smart search coordination  
- Handles cross-field searches with multiple strategies
- Manages search approaches: exact, fuzzy, contains, phonetic
- Coordinates with FieldDetector for intelligent field targeting
- Implements response size management and result optimization

#### 3. **SearchResultsFormatter** - Response optimization
- Formats search results consistently across all tools
- Handles response size limiting to prevent token overflow  
- Provides rich context about matches and confidence scores
- Supports multiple output formats (detailed, summary, minimal)

#### 4. **Enhanced Search Tools** - Improved MCP interface
- **search_entries_by_name**: Primary universal name search tool
- **search_entries_universal**: Multi-field search capability with custom strategies
- **Enhanced get_entries**: Fixed search syntax with response optimization
- **get_field_mappings**: Utility to inspect detected field types per form

### Field Detection Strategy

#### Automatic Field Type Detection:
1. **Form Structure Analysis**: Download form definition via `/forms/{id}` endpoint
2. **Label Pattern Matching**: Identify field types using label keywords:
   - Name fields: "name", "first", "last", "full name", "attendee", "participant", "member"
   - Email fields: "email", "e-mail", "mail", "contact"  
   - Phone fields: "phone", "tel", "mobile", "cell", "contact"
   - Team/Group fields: "team", "group", "with", "partner", "squad"
3. **Field Type Analysis**: Consider Gravity Forms field types (name, email, phone, text)
4. **Caching Strategy**: Store field mappings in memory/database for performance
5. **Fallback Handling**: When detection fails, search all text-type fields

#### Search Execution Flow:
1. **Field Discovery**: Get or detect field mappings for target form
2. **Query Construction**: Build search filters for identified name fields
3. **API Execution**: Execute search with proper `field_filters` syntax  
4. **Result Processing**: Format results with match context and confidence
5. **Response Optimization**: Limit response size and provide summaries when needed

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Breakdown
1. **Foundation** (Steps 1-4): Fix existing search issues, create core utilities  
2. **Field Detection** (Steps 5-7): Build intelligent field type detection system
3. **Search Engine** (Steps 8-10): Implement universal search manager with optimization
4. **Tool Integration** (Steps 11-13): Create new search tools and enhance existing ones
5. **Polish & Optimization** (Steps 14-16): Performance tuning, advanced features, comprehensive testing

### Success Criteria

#### Performance Targets:
- **Single API Call**: Most name searches complete with 1 API request
- **Response Size**: All responses under 25k tokens (no context overflow)
- **Speed**: Search results in <2 seconds
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ field detection success rate across diverse forms

#### Functionality Goals:
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works on any Gravity Form without configuration
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically finds name fields regardless of field IDs  
- **Rich Results**: Provides match confidence and context information
- **Scalable**: Handles forms with 100+ fields efficiently
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing tools unchanged unless opted-in

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix get_entries Search Syntax

**Goal**: Fix the broken search functionality in the existing get_entries tool.

**TDD Prompt:**

```typescript
Fix the search parameter handling in get_entries tool to match working export_entries_formatted syntax:

1. Write tests that verify get_entries can:
   - Handle field_filters array format correctly: {"field_filters": [{"key": "52", "value": "John"}]}
   - Execute searches with proper URL encoding  
   - Return filtered results matching the search criteria
   - Handle multiple field filters with OR logic
   - Process search alongside existing pagination and sorting parameters

2. Update the getEntries method in index.ts:
   - Change search parameter handling from flat object to support field_filters array
   - Match the working implementation from exportEntriesFormatted method
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing search parameter formats
   - Add proper URL parameter encoding for field filters

3. Test scenarios:
   - Single field filter search
   - Multiple field filters (OR logic)
   - Combination of search with pagination/sorting  
   - Invalid field filter formats (error handling)
   - Mixed search parameters (status + field_filters)

4. Validation:
   - Compare URL generation with working export_entries_formatted
   - Verify API requests use correct parameter encoding
   - Ensure existing functionality remains unchanged

The fix should make get_entries search work identically to export_entries_formatted search functionality.
```

### Step 2: Add Response Size Management to get_entries

**Goal**: Prevent context overflow by adding smart response limiting to get_entries.

**TDD Prompt:**

```typescript
Add intelligent response size management to get_entries tool:

1. Write tests that verify response size management:
   - Automatic pagination when response would be too large (>20k tokens)
   - Token estimation using character count approximation (1 token â‰ˆ 4 characters)
   - Summary mode for large entry sets with essential info only
   - Configurable response size limits
   - Proper handling of various entry data sizes

2. Implement response optimization in getEntries method:
   - Add token estimation utility method (estimateTokenCount)
   - Add entry summarization method (createEntrySummary)
   - Implement automatic page size reduction for large responses
   - Add response_mode parameter: 'full', 'summary', 'auto' (default: 'auto')

3. Create entry summary format:
   - Essential fields: id, form_id, date_created, payment_status
   - Name fields (detected or common ones like 52, 55)
   - Email fields (detected or common ones like 50, 54)
   - Key status information
   - Match indicators when part of search results

4. Test scenarios:
   - Large entry sets requiring summarization
   - Mixed entry sizes (some large, some small)
   - Search results with various response sizes
   - Manual response_mode override
   - Edge cases: empty results, single entry, malformed entries

5. Integration:
   - Update get_entries tool schema with response_mode parameter
   - Ensure backward compatibility (existing calls work unchanged)
   - Document the new summary behavior

This prevents context overflow while maintaining search functionality.
```
